Introduction:
Many analytical signals based on time-trajectories show artifacts 
appear as shifts. Of the many algorithms developed to correct for 
these artifacts DTW (named Dynamic Multi-way Warping - DMW - to 
distinguish it form other implementations) and COW are 
implemented as Matlab code.
