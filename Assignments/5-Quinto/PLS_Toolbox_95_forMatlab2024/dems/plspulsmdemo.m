% What you see on the plot is some actual process input/output
% data.  The inputs are a feed rate (bottom line) and a 
% a temperature at a particular location (top line).  The output
% is a temperature at another spot.  We would like to build a
% model that tells us what the output temperature is going to
% be given the past vaules of the feed rate and other temperature.
 
% We can immediately see that we're going to have to do some
% scaling, since the variables are very different is size.
% Lets start by doing that.

% In this view of the data we can begin to see how the data
% does appear to be correlated, but the relationship looks
% pretty complex.  Lets see if we can build a model that relates
% the process inputs to the outputs using 'plspulsm'.  First,
% however, there are several decisions we have to make.  We first
% must decide how many past samples we're going to use for each
% of the inputs.  I'm going to chose 15 and 25 for this example.
% Next, we must choose the maximum number of lv to consider. I'll
% choose 5 and set the number of cross-validation splits of
% of the data to be 5.  Finally, the time delays between 
% the inputs and output must be specified.  I'll choose
% 1 unit for each of them.

% We are now ready to use the routine.  Once it starts it will
% rewrite the data files, then use a contiguous block cross-
% validation to determine the best number of latent variables
% to use.  The PRESS plots will be shown for each trial, then
% all the PRESS plots will be shown together.  (Press any key to
% start the function after showing each of these last plots.) 
% The function will finish by showing the coefficients in the
% pulse response vector and the actual and predicted process 
% output based on the 'optimum' model.  Press a key when ready
% to start.

b = plspulsm(adata(:,1:2),adata(:,3),[15 25],5,5,[1 1]);
 
% So we see that the function chose 2 latent variables.
 
% We can use the regression vector from the 'plspulsm' function
% on the original data and rescale the result to get a better
% idea of how good the fit is.  In order to do this we need to
% write the data into the correct format using the 'wrtpulse'
% function.  We then multiply by the regression vector b, and
% then use 'rescale' (along with the mean and std. dev. of the
% original output data) to get the data back to the original
% scaling.

% So you can see that most of the time the prediction is within
