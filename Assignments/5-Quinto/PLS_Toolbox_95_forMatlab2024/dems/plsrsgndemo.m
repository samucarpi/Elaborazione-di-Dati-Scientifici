% So now that we've seen how the PCA residuals look, lets calculate
% the PLS equivilent of the PCA (I - PP') matrix using the
% 'plsresgen' function.  We'll use 4 latent variables.  When the
% function runs you will see the results of the PLS modeling
% for each variable.  Hit a key when you are ready.

% The PLS residuals look quite a bit bigger don't they?  Well, looks
% can be somewhat decieving.  The thing about the PLS residuals is
% that a change in the value of a variable causes the residual for 
% that variable to change by an equal amount.  In PCA the residual
% will change by a much smaller amount.  In fact, the amount that it
% will change is equal to the inverse of the diagonal elements of
% (I - PP').  
pause
%-------------------------------------------------
% Using this information we can now calculate detection
% limits for changes on individual variables.  For now I'm going to
% do crude detection limits, and say that the limit is equal to 2
% standard deviations in the residuals.  (This is about what it would
% be if you looked at sample set sizes of 20.  In order to do this
% accurately you would have to use f- and t-test limits)  We will   
% calculate the limits for the PLS residuals directly, and calculate
% and scale the PCA residual limits to be on the same scale as the 
% PLS residuals.

% As you can see the PLS detection limits are tighter than the PCA
% detection limits.  We can also use the scaling factors calculated
% by 'auto' to determine the detection limits in the original variable
% units, which in this case is degrees C. Hit a key when ready.

% For some of the variables the detection limit is much better than
% for others.  This depends on how highly correlated the variables
% are.  Variables which are more highly correlated with other variables
% have smaller detection limits.
 
% If you would like to find out more about these methods please
% see the reference in the PLS_Toolbox Manual.  Also, the PLS
% residuals generating matrix can be optimized by using the 
% PLSRSGCV routine which uses cross-validation to determine
% the number of latent variables to use in each of the PLS models.
